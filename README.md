# Java — Core Java Practice & Mini Projects

This repository contains my **Java learning workspace**, focused on building strong fundamentals through small programs and console-based mini projects.  
The code here reflects hands-on practice with Java syntax, logic building, object-oriented concepts, and basic application flow.

## Repository Structure

The repository consists of individual Java files, each targeting a specific concept or problem.

### Core Java Programs
- `minmax.java` — Finds minimum and maximum values from input
- `reverse.java` — Reverses numbers/strings using logic
- `duplicates.java` — Identifies duplicate elements
- `Unique_Items.java` — Extracts unique elements from a collection
- `snacks.java` — Basic conditional and input handling
- `Person.java` — Simple class-based object modeling

### Mini Console Applications
- `Course_Registration_System.java` — Simulates course registration logic
- `class_registration.java` — Class enrollment workflow
- `Grocery_Manager.java` — Grocery management console application
- `Mini_Grocery.java` — Simplified grocery system

### IDE / Build Artifacts
- `.idea/` — IntelliJ IDEA project configuration
- `out/production/java/` — Compiled class files
